## Overview

SETTLERS uses a hexagonal territory system with various states and capture mechanics. This document explains the core elements of gameplay.

:::caution[Important]
To play SETTLERS you must allow access to geolocation and physically be in the hex you want to capture. Spoofing geolocation is prohibited and may result in account restrictions.
:::

## Hex States

Each hex in the game can be in one of the following states:

### 1. Unclaimed
- Empty hex without owner
- Available for immediate capture

### 2. Your Hex
- Personally captured by you
- Part of your territory

### 3. Clan Member Hex
- Captured by a member of your clan
- Contributes to clan territory

### 4. Other Clan Hex
- Captured by a member of another clan
- Can be captured after cooldown period

### 5. Other Player Hex
- Captured by a player not from your clan
- Can be captured after cooldown period

### 6. Cooldown <Badge text="TBI" />
- Recently captured hex
- Protected for 1 hour
- Capture impossible during this period

## Capture Mechanics

:::note
Each hex can have only one owner at a time. When you capture a hex, the previous owner immediately loses control over it.
:::

### Capture Process
1. Move to the desired hex
2. Press the "Settle" button
3. Wait for confirmation

:::tip
To maximize your territory, try to capture hexes that connect with your existing territory. Connected hexes are more valuable for clan control calculations.
:::

### Results
- You become the new owner
- Hex joins your clan's territory (if applicable)
- 1-hour capture immunity begins
- Previous owner loses the hex

## Clan Dynamics

- Clan members can capture hexes from each other
- Hex remains under clan control when captured by clan member
- Only individual ownership changes
- Clan territory remains intact

## Cooldown System

The cooldown system protects recently captured territories:

:::caution[Important]
Each hex enters a 1-hour protection period immediately after capture. During this time NO ONE can capture the hex - not even clan members.
:::

- Duration: 1 hour after capture
- Protection: Capture impossible during cooldown
- Visibility: Timer visible to all players
- Purpose: Prevents immediate re-capture
